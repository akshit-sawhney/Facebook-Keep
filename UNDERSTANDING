React.createClass ---- Creates a new react component. It has some functions....
Most important of them all is "render"
render---- Returns the tree of react components that will eventually render to HTML.


ReactDOM.render()---- instantiates the root component, starts the framework, and injects markup into the raw DOM element(this raw DOM element is provided as the second argument)


ReactDOM module exposes DOM-specific methods.
React has its own tools.

ReactDOM.render() should be called after the composite components have already been defined.


Props are immutable If they are passed by parent, they are still owned by the parent.

To implement interactions, we make use of MUTABLE states.
this.state is private to the component and can be changed by calling this.setState(). When the state updates, the component is rendered again automatically.

componentDidMount is the method that is called automatically by the react when the component is rendered for the first time.
